# iniBuilds A35X Air Manager profile
This is an ongoing WIP. As soon as the first panel is finished I will publish the first official release!

## What is included
As of right now the first panel will contain the engine master switches, the engine start and the ECAM buttons.
Later on I will create more of the pedestal and th overhead.

## Compatibility
These panels are build upon the iniBuilds A350 v1.1.6 and later.
Although as the panels are specifically created for MSFS 2024, a compatibility with MSFS 2020 could be expected but cannot be guaranteed. Use at your own risk :).

## Further information
This repo contains panels and instruments for Sim Innovations Air Manager v5 (https://www.siminnovations.com/shop/air-manager-desktop/) for the iniBuilds A350-900 and A350-1000 (https://inibuilds.com/products/inibuilds-a350-airliner-msfs-2024)
All pictures are ingame screenshots done in MSFS 2024 of the iniBuilds A359.

## Additionals Software needed?
No! You don't need anything more than your sim, aircraft and Air Manager. FSUIPC is not needed for these panels
